# actions-py: GitHub Action for Python

This GitHub organization is aiming at providing **references to GitHub Actions which can be used for Python projects**.

So far the organization contains forks of GitHub repositories only.

In the future there might be a landing page like the one of [actions-rs](https://github.com/actions-rs) as well.

## Resources

The following resources are used to find Actions.

- [GitHub Marketplace (Actions)](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=)
- [GitHub search (topic:github-action)](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Agithub-action&s=stars&type=Repositories)
